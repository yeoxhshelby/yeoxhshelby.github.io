        <h1>Past Experience in Fairfield</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="fairfieldwoo">
    <p>
        My past school experiences were fruitful and enjoyable, 
        it was filled with unforgettable memories that cannot be replaced! 
        During my 10 years in Fairfield, I was given several opportunities to 
        serve as a leader and to represent my school in many different competitions. 
        I served as a prefect in my primary school from 2014 - 2015, and served 
        as a part of the Main Committee from 2015-2016. <br><br>
        
        2017 was the year where I started my secondary school, I would say that
        my time in secondary school was definitely a more exciting one! Like what I said in
        my brief introduction, I joined badminton as my CCA! I was once again given 
        the opportunity to serve as a councillor from 2018-2019,which allowed 
        me take part in many school based events like the planning of the annual 
        Secondary One Orientation and Teacher's Day Performance!
        I was also able to go for the school planned Trip for International
        Experience (TIE) in Beijing! In 2019, I was selected to be the Deputy 
        Head Councillor for my school which allowed me to hone my leadership skills
        further. <br><br>
        In Secondary 3, I was able to choose my desired subject combination in which
        I took double science comprising of Physics and Chemistry, double Maths
        as well as elective History and pure Geography. And yes! I was part of the batch
        that did their O'Level's during COVID-19 :( <br><br>
        The table below are the awards I achieved in my previous schools! The slideshow also shows
        some of my favourite memories in school! :)

                    Since I have only started school in April this year, I have yet to
                    create as many memories as I did in my previous schools. However, for
                    the past month, I have enjoyed my time thoroughly in SP! I was able to 
                    make a few friends to explore the campus together. One thing I really like
                    about SP is the six foodcourts on campus! They provide us students with a
                    variety of food and one of the dishes I personally like is the Ayam Penyet
                    in FC2 which is reasonably priced at $4.50! In SoC, I have been enjoying
                    the modules that we are learning as Year 1s, out of the 7 modules, I enjoy 
                    Fundamentals of Programming and Front-End Web Development the most! I will talk 
                    about my course more in the page under Course and Career Prospects. :)
