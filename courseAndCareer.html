                <h1><u>Diploma in Information Technology (s69)</u></h1>
                <p>    
                    The Diploma of Information Technology is one of the four courses provided
                    by the School of Computing in SP. In this course, Year 1 students are able to 
                    choose from three different specialisations in Semester 2, with the three being
                    Software Development, User Experience as well as Immersive Simulation! Year 2 students
                    can consider two different pathways, one being the normal education pathway where they 
                    continue to learn the different modules in a classroom setting. The other pathway is the 
                    Industry Now Curriculum (INC), INC provides an alternate learning programme to achieve 
                    curricular competencies by working on real-world industry projects.
                </p>
 
                <h1><u>What I Study</u></h1>
                <p>
                    All students in School of Computing have common modules in Year 1 Semester 1. 
                    We have 7 modules in the first semester which are :
                </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Communicating for Project (Proposal) Effectiveness</li>
                        <li>Critical and Analytical Thinking (CAT)</li>
                        <li>Mathematics</li>
                        <li>Education and Career Guidance 1: Personal Development</li>
                        <li>Front-End Web Development</li>
                        <li>Fundamentals of Computing</li>
                        <li>Fundamentals of Programming</li>
                    </ol>
                <p>
                    These modules are about 1.5-3 hours each session, and we spend approximately
                    25 hours per week in school. Mathematics is quite similar to E.Maths with 
                    some elements of A.Maths, so if you have a strong foundation in math,
                    I'm sure this module will be easy for you! Fundamentals of Computing 
                    will basically cover the technical side of computers, teaching students 
                    computer networking concepts and more. Fundamentals of Programming teaches 
                    us students how to solve problems with Javascript. Front-End Web Development
                    equips students with skills to develop front-end web applications using HTML
                    and CSS. For the rest of the modules, they allow students to hone their
                    presentation as well as proposal writing skills which will be beneficial
                    to them in the future. If you are interested in any of the courses 
                    under the School of Computing and would like to get started with coding, 
                    some advice I would give would be to start learning Javascript, 
                    HTML and CSS first as these will be what you will learn under 
                    Fundamentals of Programming and Front-End Web Development!

                    <h1><u>Career Prospects</u></h1>
                    <p>
                        According to Singapore Polytechnic's website, graduates can look forward to job 
                        roles such as Applications Developer, Systems Analyst, IT Consulting Analysts 
                        and Business Analyst. Other job roles that are suitable, depending on the 
                        specialisations are UX Designer, UI Designer, Data Engineer, Data Analyst 
                        and Digital Marketing Executive. For me, I am interested in pursuing a career as a 
                        UX or UI Designer and I hope I'll be able to choose the User Experience elective as
                        my specialisation in Year 1 Semester 2! <br><br>

                                    User experience (UX) designers are responsible for creating an optimal experience for 
                                    the user when they interact with a digital or physical product, 
                                    such as a website or a coffee machine. User interaction (UI) designers are primarily concerned 
                                    with how a user navigates through a digital product. UI/UX designers are responsible for overall user satisfaction with a product. 
                                    Their priority is to continually look for ways to improve the product experience, 
                                    even for bestselling products that have been on the market for years.
